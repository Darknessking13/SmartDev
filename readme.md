# SmartDev

**SmartDev** is a powerful CLI tool designed to streamline and automate your development process. It offers file watching, process monitoring, performance insights, and more, while ensuring flexibility and ease of use.

## Features
- **Automatic Process Restarting**: Restarts your application when file changes are detected.
- **Manual Restarts**: You can manually trigger restarts using the `smartdev rs` command.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor system performance in real-time, including CPU and memory usage.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Use `smartdev close` to gracefully exit the monitoring and process management.
- **File Watching**: Automatically watches files for changes (`.js`, `.mjs`, `.ejs`, `.cjs`).

## Installation

To install the **SmartDev** package, clone the repository and install the dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm i smartdev
yarn global add smartdev
pnpm add -g smartdev
```

### Usage
**Once installed, you can use the smartdev command in your terminal**

### Basic Commands

| Command              | Description                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `smartdev [entry.js]` | Starts watching for file changes and runs the specified entry point (default: `index.js`). |
| `smartdev rs`         | Manually restart the application. This command only works when a readline process is active. |
| `smartdev close`      | Closes the application gracefully. Only works when a readline process is active. |
| `smartdev monitor`    | Displays a real-time system performance monitor with CPU, memory usage, and system uptime. Requires a readline process to be active. |

### Start SmartDev

To start **SmartDev**, run the following command with the entry point to your application:

```bash
smartdev <entry point>
```
This will start watching your project files (.js, .mjs, .ejs, .cjs) for changes. When a change is detected, SmartDev will automatically restart the application for you.

If no entry point is specified, SmartDev will default to index.js.

### Manual Restart
While **SmartDev** is running, you can manually restart the application by typing:
```bash
smartdev rs
```
This command is useful when you need to manually trigger a restart without waiting for a file change. Note that the command will only work when a readline process is active, meaning SmartDev is already running.

### Monitor System Performance
You can monitor your systemâ€™s performance in real time by typing the following command:
```bash
smartdev monitor
```
**This command will display:**
* CPU Usage (%): A visual bar chart showing real-time CPU usage.
* Memory Usage (MB): Current memory consumption of the system.
* System Uptime (hours): How long your system has been running without a reboot.
* Additional System Info: Includes operating system, CPU details, and total memory.
* Note that SmartDev Monitor will only function when the readline process is active,
